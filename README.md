⚠️ This repository is dated. I do not recommend using Redux by default for your projects. ⚠️

# A React boilerplate with all the good stuff!

### Typescript ✖️ React ✖️ Redux ✖️ styled-components 💅

With built-in Redux-store, React-redux bindings and an action to fetch data from www.randomuser.me/api.

To see what happens on the redux-side, install redux-devtools: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd

No ui implemented. It's up to you ;)

Get it running:
```
npm install
npm start
```

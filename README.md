A sample Typescript x React x Redux x Styled-components project.

Contains Reudux-store and actions to fetch data from www.randomuser.me/api.

To see what happens on the redux-side, install redux-devtools: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd

No ui implemented. It's up to you ;)
